		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>Hello, and welcome! I'm studying Electrical Engineering, but I've got
		   way too many hobbies and interests beyond that with not enough time
		   for them all (; ^w^) .
		</p>

		<p>Electronics, Linux, embedded devices, and networking are the
		   interests I'm nurturing the most at the moment, so they'll get the
		   spotlight here on the site for now. I'm planning in the future to
		   expand on my other interests as well&mdash;especially once I begin adding
		   my memex {<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Wikipedia</a>}&mdash;
		   but that may slowly trickle in until I'm somewhat settled in my career.
		</p>

		<p>I'm constructing this site as I learn HTML and CSS and figure out
		   what I want to put on it, so it may go through some changes or slow
		   devlopment cycles as I think things through (and focus on schoolwork
		   or life).
		</p>

		<p>I look forward to sharing my projects, research, interests, musings,
		   and more as the site grows :3 .
		</p>
